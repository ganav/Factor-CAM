# Factor-CAM
This project includes source code, link to download our combined plant image dataset, and pretrained model

Main codes:
train_factor_regularized.py is to train models, one can edit it for own suit.
eval_cam_classifier.py and eval_cam_classifier_with_AG.py are differently edited versions of testing models, one can edit them for own suit.

Extras:
train_all_models.py is to train multiple models automatically.
and others are functions like loading dataset, extracting heatmap etc.
